            Vendor management system (VMS) that allows employers to manage their
            vendors more effectively by automating the entire vendor management
            process. The system typically includes several modules such as
            vendor onboarding, registration, job assignment, approval, and
            invoicing.

          <p class="wk-para-3 opa-color mt-2">
            Vendor management is a crucial part of any business, but it can also
            be time-consuming and challenging to manage. Many employers struggle
            to keep track of their vendors' information, including their
            credentials.
          </p>

          <p class="wk-para-3 opa-color mt-4">
            The traditional approach of managing vendors using spreadsheets or
            paper-based forms can be tedious and prone to errors. As a result,
            many businesses are seeking an efficient and automated system to
            manage their vendors.
          </p>

          <p class="wk-para-3 opa-color mt-4">
            Additionally, assigning jobs to vendors can be difficult without a
            centralized system. Employers may have to manually send emails or
            make phone calls to assign tasks and follow up on their progress.
            This can lead to delays and miscommunication, which can impact the
            overall efficiency of the organization
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-4">
          <h4 class="overview-para fw-700">Solution</h4>

          <p class="wk-para-3 opa-color mt-2">
            With a VMS, employers can streamline their vendor management
            process, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.
          </p>

          <p class="wk-para-3 opa-color mt-4">
            The vendor onboarding module allows employers to collect and verify
            vendor information, including company details, tax identification,
            insurance coverage, and credentials. Once the vendor is approved,
            employers can assign jobs to them, set deadlines, reminders and
            monitor progress. The invoicing module allows the Afrexim users to
            create invoices electronically for work completed, and the system
            can automatically generate receipts when payments are made.
